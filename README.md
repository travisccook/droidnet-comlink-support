# Droidnet Comlink Support

Welcome to the official support repository for **Droidnet Comlink**, the iOS app for hands-free voice control of astromech droids.

## 🚀 About Droidnet Comlink

Droidnet Comlink enables Star Wars droid builders to control their astromech droids using voice commands. The app listens for a customizable wake word (like "R2" or "BB-8"), recognizes spoken commands, and sends corresponding serial commands to droids via a Droidnet Signal Booster.

- 🤖 **Smart Matching** - Advanced phonetic matching handles speech variations
- 📡 **Multi-Droid Support** - Control multiple droids simultaneously
